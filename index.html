                        <p>I know that you would say, "No we're just acquaintances" if you were here but since the past 3 years, I always felt you're the closest person I have.</p>
                        <p>A lot of things have changed and gone but that feeling still stayed. I appreciate everything you do, everytime you arrive to meet me, every conversation we have and most of all, YOU.</p>
                        <p>I want to hope things stay this way for days to come, or things get even better. You're literally the best, like an insane person and an even crazier partner (like in future as in partner in sharing the same house).</p>
                        <p>I would say so many more things but I wouldn't wanna burden you with anything. Let's see where life takes us in these few years.</p>
                        <p>Love you.</p>
